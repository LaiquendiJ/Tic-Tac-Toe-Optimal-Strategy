# Tic-Tac-Toe-Optimal-Strategy

This is the code for the Game Theory Group Project 2024-2025. 
One part is using the Minimax Algorithm to find the optimal strategies.
One part is learning the game by using the Q-Learnig to train the players to find the best move.

At the end of the two algorithms, we play the game for many rounds and we can observe that by using the strategies we obtained, the game is very likely to draw.
